# End the Road Game

## Description
End the Road is a strategy game where the objective is to eliminate all the nodes on the road before reaching the goal. Each node has a number representing the number of times a player can pass through it. As the player moves, the number on the previous node decreases by one. When a node's number reaches zero, it is eliminated from the road.

## Gameplay
1. The game is played on a road consisting of interconnected nodes. Each node has a number displayed on it.
2. The player starts at the beginning of the road and can move to adjacent nodes.

3. When the player moves to a new node, the number on the previous node is reduced by one.
4. If the number on a node reaches zero, that node is eliminated from the road.
5. There are three types of nodes in the game:

   **a**. **Normal Node**: These nodes have no special abilities or restrictions. The player can pass through them until their number reaches zero.

   **b**. **Teleport Node**: These nodes allow the player to teleport between specific nodes. When the player lands on a teleport node, they can choose a destination node from the available options.

   **c**. **Jointly Node**: Jointly nodes are interconnected, and the numbers on all jointly nodes decrease simultaneously, even if the player has not passed through all of them. It requires strategic planning to navigate through these nodes efficiently.

7. The game ends when the player reaches the goal node and all nodes on the road have been eliminated.

## Winning Conditions
To win the game, the player must reach the goal node while ensuring that all the nodes on the road have been eliminated. This requires careful planning and efficient use of the available node numbers.

## Tips and Strategies
- Plan your moves carefully to ensure you have enough passes to eliminate all the nodes.
- Prioritize eliminating jointly nodes as they affect multiple nodes simultaneously.
- Utilize teleport nodes strategically to navigate the road efficiently.
- Keep track of the remaining passes on each node to plan your route effectively.
- Experiment with different strategies and approaches to find the most optimal path.
